custom dmenu patch ideas:
1. show image preview dependent on filetype
  TODO: find out how to -
    - load image preview from PDF spec
    - load image preview from common image filetypes
2. dmenu filemanager
    a. centered on screen
    b. optimized for the pwd
    c. easily accessible by custom pwd by hotkey
    d. shows preview by filetype
    e. extensible and customizable
